        knowledge”

        ## FAQ

        ### How does the 30-day free trial work?

        You can use Pulse absolutely free for 30 days. After 30 days,
        we will charge the credit card you used when you sign up. If
        you choose to cancel your account before your trial ends, your
        card will not be charged

        ### What is a “Financial Account”?

        Financial Accounts are a grouping of income and expense
        items that can be used for tracking or reporting purposes.

        They're designed to be flexible and can be used to
        differentiate between bank accounts, companies, individuals
        or between personal and business entries.

        ### Will | be able to cancel my account if I don't use Pulse?

        Yes - you can cancel your account at any time. To cancel your
        account, go to your billing page and click on “Please cancel my
        account” at the bottom of the page. The account owner is the
        only one who can cancel an account. An email request to
        delete an account is not considered cancellation.

        ### If I upgrade an existing account, do I get another free trial?

        Brand new accounts are the only ones eligible for a 30-day
        free trial. If you upgrade an existing account, your credit card
        will be billed the new amount on the date of your next billing
        cycle.

        ### Do I have to commit to a long-term contract?

        No. There is no contract when you use Pulse, other than
        agreeing to our Terms of Service.

        ### What types of payments do you accept?

        We accept payments made online using Visa, Mastercard,
        Discover, and American Express.
